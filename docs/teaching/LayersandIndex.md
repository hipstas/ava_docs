In AVAnnotate, **layers** are the organizing principle for your annotations of a recording, and may be defined according to the themes, topics, or details that are guiding your interaction with the AV artifact. **Layers and annotations work together to make meaning** in an AVAnnotate project, and deciding what meaning is being communicated to an exhibit’s audience is part of the initial conceptual work required when building a project.

Effective layers should be specific (for instance, a particular speaker, a type of editing, transcription as distinct from notes and vice-versa, etc.), but broad enough to relate to more than timestamp or annotation. Keep in mind that **layers act as thematic guides for your annotations**, but also as a rhetorical and argumentative tool to facilitate engagement with certain ideas and meanings built into a project. Layers may be categorized by functionality (i.e., linguistic layers, conceptual/thematic layers, transcription layers, environmental layers, technical layers, etc.) or by features like speaker(s), scene, plot/arc, etc. 

In AVAnnotate, **the index functions as a searchable guide to your annotations**. The index is a more granular way to explore how layers are characterizing annotations in a given project. The index collects all references to a specific term within one or more annotated recordings in the same project. Like a book’s index, terms in the index must be specific, but can range from broader subjects to individuals. For instance, an index might contain the last names of speakers who are featured on several recordings in a project. This would allow other users to easily find all annotations that relate to each speaker. However, the index could also be used to organize the main concepts that range across several recordings. For instance, in a project annotating recorded State of the Union Addresses by US presidents, we might find index entries for recurrent topics like “economy,” “war,” or “middle class.” The index is a separate page within a project that is generated from terms entered in the index column on your spreadsheet.
