# Before Teaching
<br>
Ask students to make a free GitHub account and to bring headphones to class if the recording being annotated has sound 
<br>
<br>
* Communicate a clear learning objective for using AVAnnotate and how you're situating the process of annotating AV within the larger class goals
<br>
<br>
+ Introduce students to the artifact(s) they’ll be annotating and any conceptual frameworks or key concepts that will guide their annotation process 
<br>
<br>
- Help students understand the organizing elements of AVAnnotate: layers, index, the definition of an annotation, etc. 
<br>
<br>
* Give students as much information in advance as possible! This could include the direct link to the recording file, the layers to be used, a raw annotation spreadsheet, and a link to the quick-start [How to Use](https://av-annotate.org/how-to-use/) page
</td>

# After Teaching
<br>
Debrief the annotation process with your students and what it has revealed about the recording that they hadn't noticed before 
<br>
<br>
Consider facilitating discussion about the effects of slowing down to annotate, and their decision-making processes for layers, index terms, and annotations
<br>
<br>
Discuss the evaluation criteria (if any) with students. How will their projects be continued or assessed? 
<br>
<br>
Direct students to our [Contact Us](https://av-annotate.org/contact-us/) page if you need troubleshooting support
