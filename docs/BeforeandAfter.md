| Before the Lesson  | During the Lesson | After the Lesson |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Communicate how you're situating the process of annotating AV/building AVAnnotate projects within the larger class goals | Help with formatting students' use of the AVAnnotate template, including providing samples of completed templates and guidelines for annotations | Debrief the annotation process with your students and what it has revealed about the recording that they hadn't noticed before |   
| Ask students to make a free GitHub account and to bring headphones to class if the recording being annotated has sound | Create a shared list of index terms, or support individual creation of indexes if students are annotating different recordings |  Consider facilitating discussion about the effects of slowing down to annotate, and their decision-making processes for layers, index terms, and annotations |
| Introduce students to the artifact(s) theyâ€™ll annotate and conceptual frameworks/key concepts that will guide their annotations | Give students at least 30 minutes to independently annotate the recording by practicing close-listening) | Discuss the evaluation criteria (if any) with students. How will their projects be continued or assessed? |
| Give students as much information in advance as possible! This could include the direct link to the recording file, the layers to be used, a raw annotation spreadsheet, and a link to the quick-start [How to Use](https://av-annotate.org/how-to-use/) page | Circulate among your students as they create annotations to discuss their ideas about the recordings and ensure they understand how to use the annotation spreadsheet |  Direct students to our [Contact Us](https://av-annotate.org/contact-us/) page if you need troubleshooting support |
