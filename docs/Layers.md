# Layers

## What is a layer?
In AVAnnotate, layers will be the organizing principle for your annotations of a recording. This means that layers should be specific (for instance, a particular speaker, a type of editing, transcription as distinct from notes and vice-versa, etc.), but broad enough to relate to more than one annotation. 

## What's the importance of a layer?
As the layer function organizes annotations in an AVAnnotate project, we suggest that users consider how they want to structure their annotations and select one or more layers that will organize them. Layers and annotations work together to make meaning in an AVAnnotate project, and deciding what meaning is being communicated to an exhibitâ€™s audience is part of the initial conceptual work required when building a project.

## What can listeners/viewers/readers gain from a layer?
The layer allows users to navigate an AVAnnotate project according to the themes, topics, and details the developer has recognized in their AV artifact. Not only is the layer a guide but an argumentative tool which facilitates engagement with certain ideas and meanings built into a project.
