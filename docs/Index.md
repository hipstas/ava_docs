# Index

## What is an index? 
In AVAnnotate, the index is a separate page within a project that is generated from terms entered in the Index column on your spreadsheet. The index collects all references to a specific term within one or more annotated recordings in the same project. Like a book’s index, terms in the index must be specific, but can range from broader subjects to individuals. For instance, an index might contain the last names of speakers who are featured on several recordings in a project. This would allow other users to easily find all annotations that relate to each speaker. However, the Index could also be used to organize the main concepts that range across several recordings. For instance, in a project annotating recorded State of the Union Addresses by US presidents, we might find index entries fo recurrent topics like “economy,” “war,” or “middle class.”


## What is the difference between an index term and a layer name? 
The difference between index terms and layer names depends on the organization of your AVAnnotate project. If a layer is the organizing principle for annotations, then the index functions as a more granular roadmap to sort through any associated set of annotations and layers. The index can help viewers locate relationships between people, places, ideas, or themes which the developer deems significant. This feature provides another unique way to traverse connections in a single or multiple AVAnnotate project(s).


## How do I use the index with multiple AV artifacts? 
AVAnnotate’s index feature allows users to make connections between audiovisual artifacts, meaning that a project with two or more AV materials needs only a single index. If, for example, an exhibit contains more than one audio file covering a specific topic, location, or theme, the index allows for viewers to sort through each audio file according to predetermined terms.


## When do I use the index? 
As the index feature is not a requirement for building an exhibit with AVAnnotate, users may choose to include or exclude the feature. The index feature is suggested for projects which use multiple AV artifacts and/or include lengthy AV files which may be better accessed with both a layer and an index as methods of categorization.
