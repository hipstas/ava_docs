Time Stamps
What is a time stamp?
Time stamps are used to mark annotations on recordings in AVAnnotate. Time stamps are used to tie annotation to specific moments. Time stamps may indicate a duration in time, like 1:30-2:00, or a moment in time, like 2:01.

How do I format a time stamp?
Time stamps should be formatted as such: 0:00:01 would be one second; 0:01:01 would be one minute and one second; 01:01:01 would be one hour, one minute, and one second.

What is a good interval of time to use? 
Often shorter intervals make it easier to find particular moments in a recording. However, longer intervals of time may be appropriate if, for instance, you do not want to break up an interviewee’s long reply to an interviewer’s question or if a recording is very long. The length of the interval may also depend upon the categories you select for your layers since time stamps correspond to both an annotation and a layer.

Why choose duration over point annotations?
Marking a duration in time may be important if you want to find out where a speaker in a group begins and ends their portion of the dialogue. Durations may also be useful if you are remarking on the length of a particular cinematic sequence, a particular environmental sound in an audio recording, or really anything on a recording where the length of time is a factor in your analysis.
